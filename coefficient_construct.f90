! Name: coefficient_construct
! Inputs: A(coefficient matrix), source(source vector, T(Temperature vector)
! Outputs: A, source
! Description: Subroutine reads in a 1-D vector of temperatures and stores them
!	       in a 2-D matrix to be used in LU decomposition. Subroutine also
!	       reads in and creates the source vector for LU decomposition.
