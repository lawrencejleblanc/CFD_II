create a file from any way you know how in the local folder.
in bash run: git add <filename>
then run: git commit
that command will open up either vim or nano to create a commit message.
type something informative, save it to the location already set up, and quit
the run: git push
this actually sends it to github.  you'll be required to enter a user/pass
